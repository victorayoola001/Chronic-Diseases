## Project Overview
#### This Project seeks to explore the prevalence of various chronic diseases across different age groups in the U.S. It showcases the relationship between chronic conditions and how they affect young and older populations, while also highlighting specific risk factors that predispose each population group to these chronic conditions. 
### Tools & Technologies
1. SQL (MySQL Workbench)
2. Jupyter notebook
3. PowerBi
4. Excel

### Data cleaning process
* Converted numeric and string columns to proper data type formats
* Removed invalid values
* Created new calculated fields
* Filled in missing values, and those that couldn't be filled were removed

### Key Insights
- The age group with the highest population based on sample size is 65-69
- The highest ethnic race represented is white only, non-Hispanic
- Arthritis, Depressive Disorder, and Asthma are the most common chronic conditions in the US Population
- These conditions are more common in females than males
- The least common chronic condition is stroke, as only 4% of the population reported having or having had a stroke
- The elderly population 80 years and older is more affected by stroke
- The most common condition among the younger population between 18 and 34 years is depressive disorder
- 5% of the entire population has had a heart attack
- 7% of people with Arthritis also reported having difficulty in dressing and walking

### Recommendation(s)
- More preventive interventions should be targeted towards the three most common chronic conditions in the U.S
- More research should be done to discover risk factors that make females more predisposed to these conditions
- The Geriatric population requires special neurological attention and should be factored into their basic care
- Personalized therapy sessions should be mandated for the younger population, 18 to 34 years, based on individual needs
